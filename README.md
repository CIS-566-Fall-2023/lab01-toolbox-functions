3. Modify the base code to create a new flower!
- Ideas: add additional shapes, create an interior for the flower, change the animation, make your flower explode, add an animated background, use color gradients.

- Create a pull request to this repository
- In the README, include the names of both your team members
- In the README, create a link to your shader toy solutions for these three prompts
- Make sure all three of your shadertoys are set to UNLISTED or PUBLIC (so we can see them!)
